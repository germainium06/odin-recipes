        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A simple recipe for classic thin pancakes to try at home!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Makes approximately 3 servings.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>300g Flour</li>
            <li>100ml Milk</li>
            <li>2 Eggs</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon of oil</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon of sugar (you can add more depending on your preference)</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all the ingredients together into one mixing bowl. I prefer to combine the dry ingredients first and then the wet ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat up and add oil to a frying pan until it feels warm when you hover your hand above it.</li>
            <li>Pour some of the mixture into the frying pan and tilt the pan so the mixture evenly covers the surface of the pan.</li>
            <li>Flip the pancake once you see the edges start to go brown.</li>
            <li>Once both sides have a brown spotty pattern, transfer the pancake to your plate.</li>
            <li>Repeat until you have no more mixture left.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your pancakes with whatever toppings you like!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Helpful Tips!</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can use one bowl to weigh your ingredients as long as you reset the scale just before you weigh the ingredient.</li>
            <li>Use a ladle or pour the mixture into a measuring jug to make pouring the mixture easier to control.</li>
            <li>Don't set the heat too high, a lower heat will help you prevent burning.</li>
            <li>Add a small amount of oil every couple pancakes you cook to make flipping the pancake easier.</li>
        </ul>
